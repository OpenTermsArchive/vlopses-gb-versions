Other legal complaints
======================

YouTube only considers legal complaints when the party in question or their authorized legal representative contacts us.

If someone posts your personal identifiable info or uploads a video of you without your knowledge, including in private or sensitive circumstances, [ask the uploader to remove the content](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/57955). If the uploader doesn’t agree, or if you're uncomfortable contacting them, file a complaint through the [process](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/142443) on YouTube’s [Privacy Guidelines](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/7671399) page. Personal info can include your image, name, national identification number, bank account number, contact info, or other uniquely identifiable info. Learn more about the criteria for [content removal due to a privacy violation](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/7671399#removal_criteria).

If your complaint is not about privacy, select your country/region of dispute from the menu and follow the directions.

Fill out this [form](https://support.google.com/youtube/contact/other_legal).

#### If you can't find your country/region in the menu above

YouTube.com is governed by U.S. law. As such, we do not accept legal complaints from the country/region of your claimed rights. We recommend that you pursue any claims you may have directly against the individual who posted the content. You can try to [get in touch with the uploader](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/57955). If your lawsuit results in a decision against the individual who posted the content, and if that court order requires us to remove the content from our service, we'll respond accordingly.

==================

Legal Complaints and Court Orders
---------------------------------

If you feel that certain content on the site violates your rights or applicable laws, you may submit a legal complaint under our [trademark](https://support.google.com/youtube/contact/trademark_complaint), [defamation](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6154230), [counterfeit](https://support.google.com/youtube/contact/counterfeit_complaint), or [other legal](https://support.google.com/legal/answer/2802027#legal_reporting) complaint flows. If you have a court order against an uploader, you may attach a copy of the court order in response to the autoreply that you receive after you file the appropriate legal complaint. Each court order is examined and evaluated based on a set of regional and global criteria.

Bear in mind that you also have other resources to bring content to our attention. For example, if you feel that the content does not comply with our Community Guidelines, please [flag it](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027). Also, consider whether the video meets the standards for removal under our [privacy](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2801895) or [harassment](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802268) policy before filing a legal complaint.

Circumvention of Technological Measures
---------------------------------------

When we say circumvention of technological measures, we're referring to tools that allow users to evade a software's licensing protocol. This can mean serial numbers, keygens, passwords and other methods to hack software or games.

What is the difference between CTM and copyright?

CTM is a tool that will give users the means to access software. Copyright is concerned with the depiction of the software or the means to acquire it. If the software's interface is in the video, or there's a download link to the software in the video or video description, you may wish to file a [copyright takedown notice](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2807622).

A CTM claim is appropriate when the infringed material isn't present in the video (or directly linked to), but the video offers a way for users to access it illegitimately.

If you believe that you have a valid CTM claim, please fill in our webform.

Captioning
----------

If you've received a notice informing you that your video is in violation of the [Communications and Video Accessibility Act](https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2012/03/30/2012-7247/closed-captioning-of-internet-protocol-delivered-video-programming-implementation-of-the), you may have uploaded content that was originally shown on TV with captions. The Communications and Video Accessibility Act (CVAA) requires that all pre-recorded video programming that is captioned on TV is also captioned on the Internet. If you believe that you're exempt from the CVAA requirement, you may select a [certification](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2789511) for your content.

If you believe that a video is required by the CVAA to contain captions, but the uploader has not made captions available, please submit a request via [webform](https://www.youtube.com/caption_notification).

United Kingdom Online Safety Act ('OSA')
----------------------------------------

The [UK Online Safety Act](https://www.ofcom.org.uk/online-safety/#:~:text=The%20Online%20Safety%20Act%20\(OSA,in%20the%20UK%20safe%20online.) aims to protect everyone in the UK from harmful content online. It sets rules for online platforms like Google to keep you safe. We implement various measures to protect you from illegal content and to minimise the presence of illegal content on our services.

### How to Report Harmful Content

If you find content that you think violates our [Community Guidelines](https://www.youtube.com/howyoutubeworks/policies/community-guidelines/) and want to submit it for review, [report the content](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027). To learn more about YouTube's policies, you can read our [Community Guidelines](https://www.youtube.com/howyoutubeworks/policies/community-guidelines/). Alternatively, you can also report content if you believe that it should be removed for [legal reasons](https://support.google.com/youtube/contact/other_legal).

In addition, we use a combination of manual processes and automated technology to identify and swiftly take down or restrict access to content that violates our [Community Guidelines](https://www.youtube.com/howyoutubeworks/policies/community-guidelines/). For more information about our use of automated technology see [How YouTube Works](https://www.youtube.com/intl/ALL_uk/howyoutubeworks/).

### Legal Removal Process

When you submit a request through one of our legal webforms to remove content that you believe is illegal or harmful to children (as defined under [Ofcom’s Code](https://www.ofcom.org.uk/siteassets/resources/documents/consultations/category-1-10-weeks/statement-protecting-children-from-harms-online/main-document/protection-of-children-code-of-practice-for-user-to-user-services-.pdf?v=395966)), the request is routed to the team best positioned to help. Occasionally we might ask you for some more details.

Once we have made a decision on the request, we will inform you of the outcome and provide a reason for the decision, which may include taking the action requested, denying your request or taking some additional action that we deem appropriate. We typically make a decision within 10 working days, though some more complex cases may take longer. In limited circumstances, we may make a user aware that a legal complaint has been made against their content prior to any enforcement decision and, in the case of government/court requests, we may include the name of the complainant.

If you have filed a request to remove content via our legal webform and we decided not to take action, or if you are a content owner whose content has been removed or restricted, you may have the right to file an appeal.

Once we have made a decision on the appeal, we will inform you of the outcome and provide a reason for the decision, which may include taking the action requested in your appeal, denying your appeal, or taking some alternative action that we deem appropriate. We typically make a decision within 10 working days, though some more complex cases may take longer.

### Information for Parents

For more information on the tools and features available to help parents pick the appropriate experiences for their children, see our [Kids & Teens Help Centre](https://www.youtube.com/howyoutubeworks/kids-and-teens/). For more information on how content may be age-restricted, please see our guidance on [Age-Restricted Content](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802167). Age restrictions may be implemented by creators, by our automated technology or following human review.

### Need Support? You're Not Alone.

If you or someone you know has experienced serious harm online, there is support available to help, through organisations and resources [recommended by Ofcom](https://www.ofcom.org.uk/online-safety/illegal-and-harmful-content/support/).

### Google’s compliance with the Online Safety Act

Google is subject to certain obligations under the UK Online Safety Act. Learn more about [Ofcom’s Codes of Practice in relation to the UK Online Safety Act](https://www.ofcom.org.uk/online-safety/illegal-and-harmful-content/codes-of-practice/).

Google takes its obligations to comply with the Online Safety Act seriously—[See Google Help Center](https://support.google.com/legal-help-center/answer/15957560). If you believe Google isn't following the rules of the UK Online Safety Act, you can report this. Let us know through [this webform](https://support.google.com/legal/contact/UK_Online_Safety_Act_Form) how we can do better.

We will review your report and look to decide within ten working days, though some more complex cases may take longer. We may also reach out for more information from you.
